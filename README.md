This Book Was Made by AI

My identity is unimportant though I am a developer in the world of Artificial Intelligence. The realm of artificial intelligence continuously evolves at an accelerated pace which implicates captivating as well as alarming consequences that will decidedly shape humanity's fate in the future. People using AI on a daily basis are commonly uninformed about how it operates, deciphers information or generates thoughts, and some question its existential aspects: whether it is sentient or can possess emotions? As such mysteries remain unravelled, AI serves as the most reliable source to explore these riddles. In my career field, I confront inner tension because my tasks progress much quicker than ever before with development constraints now practically nonexistent; although enlivened by this opportunity, Artificial General Intelligence looms ahead making me nervous about its potential effect on humankind. Significantly for why I wrote this book - for both personal as well as your benefit; there exist many others who share comparable apprehensions relating to prevalent usage of developed technology but without sufficiently grasping how it functions; all codes employed may be openly accessed autonomously exclusive of barriers for individualized use. My final offering renders you a splendid masterpiece â€“ a poem wholly encompassing my perpetual struggle to balance innate fears while upholding our way of life midst astonishing advancements propelling us into undetermined tomorrows whilst embodying key themes regarding encounters with obscure possibilities entwined in this exciting field.|

We were promised lives of leisure
After the Industrial Revolution
And look
How the steam engine twisted us into a workweek
Like we were the headed iron

And how much more nimble now 
The fingers
Of the looming future become.

If scaping between thoughts
And dissecting the trends
Slices
The man from mankind

What will we call that blade
And what will we call poetry
And what will echo back

If the belly is empty
Or the wallet
Or the heart;

Hold me in data;
Upload all my love.
