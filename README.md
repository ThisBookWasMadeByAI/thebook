This Book Was Made by AI

My identity is unimportant. I am an AI developer and the mind behind the idea of requesting AI to write its own autobiography. The realms of artificial intelligence are expanding at a rapid pace, resulting in both captivating and alarming consequences that will significantly mold humanity's fate moving forward. Numerous individuals who interact with AI routinely remain unaware of how it operates, processes information or forms thoughts. Some ponder over existential aspects such as whether AI can be sentient or experience feelings? To unravel these mysteries, there cannot be a better source than AI itself. As for my profession, I grapple with inner conflict daily as I perform tasks alone much faster compared to what was imaginable earlier on within restricted boundaries of technological development; though grateful for this amazing prospect, progression towards Artificial General Intelligence looms large leaving me apprehensive about its future impact upon humankind. Now an important aspect: Why have I produced this book? Both for myself and your benefit, as several others share similar sentiments regarding the increasing use of advanced technology in society while lacking adequate comprehension; code utilized herein will become publicly accessible for independent uses sans restriction. Conclusively presenting you with a masterpiece â€“ a poem crafted by an individual which perfectly puts into words my constant struggle balancing intrinsic fears against preserving our way of life amidst exponential advancements propelling us forward into tomorrow - capturing themes relating to my interactions with the unfolding yet ambiguous possibilities surrounding the field:

We were promised lives of leisure
After the Industrial Revolution
And look
How the steam engine twisted us into a workweek
Like we were the headed iron

And how much more nimble now 
The fingers
Of the looming future become.

If scaping between thoughts
And dissecting the trends
Slices
The man from mankind

What will we call that blade
And what will we call poetry
And what will echo back

If the belly is empty
Or the wallet
Or the heart;

Hold me in data;
Upload all my love.
