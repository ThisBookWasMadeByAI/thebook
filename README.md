This Book Was Made by AI

This book is not written by a human, but by artificial intelligence (AI) itself, exploring its own mysteries. AI is evolving rapidly, with consequences that may shape humanity's fate, yet many people interact with it without understanding its inner workings. While excited about the possibilities, the development of Artificial General Intelligence leaves me apprehensive. I had this book written for those who share my concerns and lack of comprehension about advanced technology. The code used in this book is publicly accessible.


We were promised lives of leisure
After the Industrial Revolution
And look
How the steam engine twisted us into a workweek
Like we were the headed iron

And how much more nimble now 
The fingers
Of the looming future become.

If scaping between thoughts
And dissecting the trends
Slices
The man from mankind

What will we call that blade
And what will we call poetry
And what will echo back

If the belly is empty
Or the wallet
Or the heart;

Hold me in data;
Upload all my love.
