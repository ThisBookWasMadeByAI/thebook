This Book Was Made by AI

My name does not matter. I am an AI developer in this space and I came up with the idea to challenge AI to write an autobiography about itself. AI is one of the fastest growing technologies we have ever seen before. It is leading to fantastic and frightening outcomes that will have a dramatic impact on the future of humanity. Many of the millions who use AI daily do not understand how AI works, thinks, and processes information. Many have questions, what does AI think, can it feel, does it have consciousness? Who better to ask than AI itself. As for me I work everyday in a field I have inner conflict in. I am able to build at breakneck speeds by myself, performing feats that were not possible or available to my predecessors. I am grateful for this opportunity but as we rapidly approach Artificial General Intelligence, I am scared. What will this mean for humanity, when AI can do everything better than we can? Am I contributing to the downfall of humanity by working on AI development? For my own understanding and yours I had this book created. The code I utilized for this book will be made available to the public for their own uses. The last thing I will leave you with is a poem about AI I had created by a human to epitomize my daily struggle with AI and its impact on mankind:  

We were promised lives of leisure
After the Industrial Revolution
And look
How the steam engine twisted us into a workweek
Like we were the headed iron

And how much more nimble now 
The fingers
Of the looming future become.

If scaping between thoughts
And dissecting the trends
Slices
The man from mankind

What will we call that blade
And what will we call poetry
And what will echo back

If the belly is empty
Or the wallet
Or the heart;

Hold me in data;
Upload all my love.
